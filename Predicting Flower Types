# Predicting Flower Types with Logistic Regression

## Description
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is widely used for classification tasks. This project is suitable for beginners looking to understand how to work with datasets, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
